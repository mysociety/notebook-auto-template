# Python data repo auto template

This is a self-formatting template, building on the [cookie cutter template](https://github.com/mysociety/cookie_data_repo) for a [mySociety data repo](https://github.com/mysociety/template_data_repo). Based on [Simon Willison's approach](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/28/dynamic-github-repository-templates/).

Click the 'Use this template' button, and give a useful name (snakecase) and description, which will populate the readme.md of the new repo. 

If you have done this, and you are looking at this message in the new repo, wait twenty seconds and refresh. If this message is still here, investigate the status of the github action in the 'Actions' tab.
